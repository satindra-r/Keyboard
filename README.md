# Keyboard
Well so you decided to try it out it's not going to be great but it's kinda good here is what you have to do:
config.jar:minor distraction (use scroll on progress bars for animation)
keyboard.bat:actual stuff
kill.bat:kills java
kill_all.bat:kills java and command prompt(batch files too)
swat.bat:kills java repeatedly
the actual stuff has two phases
1.unresponsiveness
2.torture
unresponsiveness can be exited by scrolling down or up depending upon mouse setting(try both to see which works)
after unresponsiveness, torture starts. here are the stuff that it does:
1.message typing
2.capslock toggle
3.mouse random movement
4.mouse jitter
5.random mouse scrolling
6.beeping
the only way to exit it to use any of the java killers or task manager
good luck!!
